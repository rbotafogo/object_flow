    "comment": "If the identified object and the tracked object have an iou of at least 'iou_match', then consider that they are the same object.  In camera 9, when a person is entering from bellow, its head is first identified, then the whole body is identified, in this case bbox(head)/bbox(body) is often small and the person is identified twice or even more times, then iou_match should be a small number.  However, if we make this number two small, then we might not identify a kid in a parents arm.  In order to reduce this problem we can also use the drop_overlap parameter.  If two tracked object have 'drop_overlap' percent overlap, then consider that they are the same object and drop the last one.  Another alternative to this problem is to only identify an object when it is a bit away from the entry border.",
